File Path: ui.js
Summary:
This file is the user interface for the project's AI-powered task completion system. It accepts a task from the user, uses AI to complete the task, and saves the solution to a file. The file uses various modules such as `fs`, `fast-glob`, `chalk`, and `prompts` to read files, count tokens, and prompt the user for input. The file also uses various agents, such as `getFiles`, `codeReader`, and `coder`, to perform AI-related tasks. The `readAllSummaries` function gets all `.ai.txt` files and combines their contents to provide context for the AI. The `saveOutput` function saves the solution to a file in the "suggestions" folder. The `getTaskInput` function prompts the user for a task input. The `receiveUserTask` function receives the user's task input, reads all summaries, and asks the project manager if the task needs to be broken down into smaller tasks. The function then performs each small task and saves the final solution to a file. The `doTask` function uses AI to determine the relevant files and code context for the task, and then uses AI to provide the necessary changes to complete the task. Overall, this file contributes to the project by providing a user-friendly interface for the AI-powered task completion system.
