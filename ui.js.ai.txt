File Path: ui.js
Summary:
This file is the user interface for a code-related task completion program. It accepts a task from the user and uses AI to complete the task. The file imports various modules for user input, file system output, and agents (AI functions) to complete the task. The file also defines several functions, including one to run an agent function asynchronously, one to get command line options, and one to get the task to be completed. The main function is the entry point for the program and orchestrates the various steps involved in completing the task, including getting relevant files, asking an agent about each file, and saving the solutions to a file. The program can run in interactive mode or auto-apply mode, depending on the user's preference.
