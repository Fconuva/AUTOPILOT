## Features

### CreateSummaries script:

- üìö Pre-processes all the relavent code base files.
- üëÄ A watcher continuously updates files that have been modified.

### üñ•Ô∏è UI script:

- üß© Desides what files to update for the given task.
- ü§ñ Does code updates for you.
- üìã Shows you what was updated. Full process log with each AI interaction also produced.
- üîß Optional interacrive mode to see the process and retry, continue, abort options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fjrdomingues/autopilot.git`
2. Do `cd autopilot` to install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create the `.env` file and set up the environment variables:
   1. Copy the .env.template file to .env: `cp .env.template .env`
   2. Set up an OpenAI API key and file with the key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`. [Create openAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   3. Set the path to your code `CODE_DIR=<path-to-your-code>`
   4. Update `IGNORE_LIST=node_modules,coverage,public,__tests__`
   5. Update `FILE_EXTENSIONS_TO_PROCESS=.js,.tsx,.ts,.jsx`
   
## Running
### 1. The indexer
* `node createSummaryOfFiles --all` - creates a summary of all files (required for first run) and starts the watcher.
* `node createSummaryOfFiles` - starts the watcher for any code changes which would trigger a file re-index.
### 2. The tasker
* `node ui -t "YOUR_TASK"` - is the easiest way to start.
  * Solutions will be auto applied on your code and a git diff shown if possible. 
  * Alternatively you may specify `--auto-apply=false`.
* `node ui -h` - will show you all the options.

## Test/Interactive mode
This project is still in alpha stage. It's recommended that you use `node ui -i` for an interactive mode here you can review the output of every step before proceeding.

## Components

- **createSummaryOfFiles.js**: Manages the code summarization process for JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- **ui.js**: Handles the user interface (UI) interaction and utilizes the GPT-based summaries to complete tasks.

## ü§ù Contributing

**We are running autopilot on a server connnected to the https://github.com/fjrdomingues/autopilot repository. New issues created will trigger autopilot and  create a new Pull Request with a proposal. Running with gpt-4**

We welcome contributions! Please submit pull requests to the repository, and ensure your changes align with the project's goals and guidelines. Together, we can make **Autopilot** an even more powerful and efficient tool for developers!
