Ideas:
An AI app that assists a software developer in creating code on existing projects.

How it works:
The app uses AI to create summaries of all relevant files and uses the summaries to find what files and functions are relevant.
The app has some agency and has the ability to go from the general understanding on how the app works into the functions that are relevant for a certain task.

Architecture:
CreateSummaries:
- Read all relevant files in the project (first version uses .js files)
- Create a summary (using GPT AI API) that represents a mental model for each file. This is done to save tokens and will later be used to understand what are the relevant files for a TASK
- The app saves the summary next to each file with a .ai.txt extension
ui:
- The app takes into account the TASK and all the summary files (.ai.txt)
- Then uses GPT AI API to ask what files are relevant to the task
- The using the previous reply, the app gets the source code of each relevant file and sends each to GPT to get the relevant context
- Then Saves (temporarely) the output of each file in the previous step
- The sends the saved output to GPT and ask for the necessary changes to do the TASK
- Then the user will then apply the suggested changes manually.
