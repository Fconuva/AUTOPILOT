File Path: modules/userInputs.js
Summary:
This file contains a function that prompts the user to enter a task. It uses the 'prompts' library to display a text input field and validate that the user has entered a task. The function is asynchronous, meaning it can handle multiple tasks at once. The 'getTaskInput' function is exported so that it can be used in other parts of the project.
