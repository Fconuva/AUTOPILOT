File Path: modules/summaries.js
Summary:
This file contains several functions and constants that are used in a project. 

The `require('dotenv').config()` line loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. 

The `countTokens` function is imported from `tokenHelper.js` and is used to count the number of tokens in a string. 

The `chalk`, `fs`, `fg`, and `path` modules are imported for use in other functions. 

The `ignorePattern` constant is set to an array of strings that represent file patterns to ignore when searching for files. 

The `maxSummaryTokenCount` constant is set to a maximum number of tokens allowed in a summary. 

The `types` object defines a `FileObject` type with `path` and `code` properties. 

The `chunkSummaries` function takes an array of summary strings and splits them into chunks up to a maximum size. 

The `getFiles` function takes an array of file objects and returns an array of file objects with a `code` property containing the file's contents. 

The `readAllSummaries` function reads all `.ai.txt` files in a directory and returns a string containing all the summaries concatenated together. 

The `getSummaries` function fetches and validates summaries for a given test. 

Finally, the module exports all the functions and constants for use in other files.
