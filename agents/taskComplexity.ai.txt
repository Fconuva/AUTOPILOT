Summary:
This file defines a function called taskComplexityAgent, which takes in summaries and a task as inputs. The purpose of this function is to determine the complexity of a software development task and decide if it needs to be broken down into smaller, less complex JIRA tasks. The function uses GPT to process a given prompt, which includes user input, context, and response format in JSON. The response from GPT contains thoughts (including reasoning, criticism, and a summary) and a list of tasks with their titles and descriptions. The taskComplexityAgent function then returns the result after parsing the JSON response. This module contributes to the overall project by assisting project managers in breaking down tasks into manageable JIRA tasks for software development teams.
