Summary:
This file exports a function called `getRelevantContextForFile` which takes in a `task` and a `file` object and returns a promise that resolves to an array of relevant code snippets from the `file`. The function uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a prompt that asks the user to extract relevant parts of source code for a given `task`. The prompt includes the `task`, `file` context, and `file` code. The user must respond in JSON format with an array of relevant code snippets and a summary of their thoughts and reasoning. The function then parses the user's response and returns the array of relevant code snippets. This function contributes to the overall project by providing a way for users to extract relevant code snippets from files based on a given task.
