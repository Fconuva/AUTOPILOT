File Path: agents/codeReader.js
Summary:
This file exports a function called "getRelevantContextForFile" which takes in a task and a file object as parameters. The function uses the "callAgent" function from the "../agents/genericAgent" module and a prompt template to generate a response that includes relevant source code for the given task. The response is then parsed using the "jsonParseWithValidate" function from the "../modules/gpt" module and returned. The response includes the relevant source code and a reason for why it was selected, as well as a summary of thoughts to say to the user. The context source code is also included in the response for reference.
