File Path: createSummaryOfFiles.js
Summary:
This file is a Node.js script that summarizes code files in a directory using an AI model. It uses various Node.js modules such as `chalk`, `yargs`, `fs`, `path`, `chokidar`, and `prompts`. The script reads the directory path and model name from the command-line arguments and prompts the user to proceed with summarizing the project. It then calculates the project size in tokens and estimates the cost of summarizing the project using the specified model. 

The script then watches for file changes in the directory using `chokidar` and processes the modified file using the `processFile` function. The `processFile` function reads the file content, prompts the user with a task description, and calls the `callGPT` function to generate a summary using the specified AI model. If the summary is generated successfully, the function saves the summary to a new file with the same name as the original file but with an additional `.ai.txt` extension. 

The script also includes a `calculateProjectSize` function that recursively calculates the size of the project in tokens by counting the tokens in each file in the directory and its subdirectories. The script ignores files with extensions specified in the `fileExtensionsToProcess` array and directories specified in the `ignoreList` array. 

Finally, the script includes a `main` function that calls the `processDirectory` function to summarize all code files in the directory if the `--all` option is specified. Otherwise, it watches for file changes in the directory and summarizes the modified files using the `processFile` function.
